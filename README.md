# Vince API Starter

A simple _starter-kit_ for developing *DARRT*-style APIs. *DARRT* is an acronym which stands for Data, Actions, Resources, Representations, & Transitions. The *DARRT* library is used in the book "Design and Build Great Web APIs" (https://pragprog.com/book/maapis/design-and-build-great-web-apis).

## Set up your project
First, FORK this repo (or just copy the `/dartt/` folder and the root `index.js` and `package.json` files into your own project folder).

This project has a `package.json` which identifies the following runtime dependencies:
 *   `body-parser`
 *   `cors`
 *   `ejs`
 *   `express`

You can use `npm install` to update all dependencies. If you just copy the files, be sure to install/update the dependencies yourself.

## Update the control files
The project SHOULD work "out-of-the-box" as a simple CRUD-style API to manage persons.  To make this work for your own API needs, you only need to update the files in the `/darrt/` folder. See the steps below for details.

## The DARRT folder
The `/darrt/` folder holds the framework base files:
 * `data.js`
 * `actions.js`
 * `resources.js`
 * `representations.js`
 * `transitions.js`

These four files are the ones you'll edit to match your API needs.

### The `lib` and `representors` folders
There are two subfolders, too: `/darrt/lib` and `/darrt/representors/`. The `lib` folder holds the operational support files for managing the information in your control files in the `/darrt/` folder. The `representors` folder holds response representation templates (using `ejs`) matched to media-type strings. The representors in the base library are:
 * application/json
 * text/csv
 * application/forms+json
 * application/links+json (alpha)
 * application/prag+sjon (beta)
 
You can edit these and add new representors for additional media types as needed.

### The `darrt/data.js` file
This defines what state is passed back and forth
 * properties (MUST include `id`, `dateCreated`, & `dateUpdated`; SHOULD include `status`)
 * enums
 * requireds
 * defaults

### The `darrt/actions.js` file
This implements the internal functionality your service supports through a series of exported functions. See the included `actions.js` for examples.
 
### The `darrt/resources.js` file
This file contains the routes and calling routines for all the URLs in your API and maps to the actions. This is the classic *express.js*-style `router.get(...)`, `router.post(...)` set of operations that _call_ the exported `actions.js` methods via a special operation (`utils.handler(...)`). See the included `resources.js` for examples.

### The `representation.js` file
This file contains the response representations your service supports. This is based on the _representor_ pattern. See the `darrt/representors/` folder for built-in examples of a handful of media-type representors.

### The `transitions.js` file
This file contains all the links and forms your service API will emit at runtime.  If you are only supporting `application/json` or `text/csv` or some other format that has no hypermedia support, you can ignore this step.

## Data Storage
The current project just stores the passed state on disk in the `/data/` folder. This is handled by the `/darrt/lib/components.js` and `/darrt/lib/storage.js` files. You can use this local storage approach or update it to use more robust storage tooling yourself and just modify the dependencies. NOTE that in this release, storage is implemented without support for Promises. A future version will make storage fully 'then-able' to make adding remote adpaters easy to do.
